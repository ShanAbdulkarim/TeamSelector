I created a system that allows you to take soccer players out of a pool and create your own team with them. you can then save this information to have it whenever. 
It is still in development and may be updated in the future.

To properly use this system you must first place all of these files into a folder named selector. And then you must put that selector folder into another folder named drafter. 

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
